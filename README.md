This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Characteristics of photo-sharing apps
Instagram has three distinctive characteristics:

'The social aspect'. (profiles, followers, likes, shares, comments)
Photo-editing tools. (crops, frames, filters, collages, stickers)
Filtered discovery functions. (hashtags, usernames, locations, popular posts)
Even though we titled this article “What Does it Take to Develop an Instagram Clone?” your app doesn't necessarily have to be a copy of Instagram. Many popular apps, like Photogrid, are exclusively photo editing tools that offer instant sharing to other social media apps. Let's say you are set on developing a photo-sharing app. 

'Social media marketing': Create a page dedicated to your app on social media and start communicating with your customers on this page before you launch your app. Social media marketing helps you develop a potential user base even before the your app is available. Try the following strategy: Register a social media account 3-6 months before launch. Communicate what you offer in a style that speaks to your target audience. For millennials that might mean memes and funny videos; for professional photographers, it might mean captivating content created with your app. When people share your content through social media you can capture the attention of a broad segment of your market. Keep your followers’ attention by posting at least once a week.   

'Referral program': When you get your first users you can reward them for inviting their friends to use your app. Rewards might include new filters, special photo effects or any other features your app offers. The iOS to-do list app Clear, for example, has a reward system that lets you unlock secret backgrounds by completing promotional tasks such as sharing a story on Facebook.  

'Invite influencers': People who already have popular accounts on other photo sharing apps, such as Instagram, have the potential to boost the profile of your app. So how do you get these people to download and try out your app? One solution is to provide them with free PR, which might include featuring them in discovery pages of your app or in email newsletters. Alternatively, you can offer influencers full access to your app even if some tools are normally paid upgrades.

'PR strategy': One way to introduce your photo sharing app to a large audience is by getting in contact with relevant bloggers and journalists. Media sites that write about tech startups or photography are ideal targets. If you want your app to gain a reputation among professional photographers, then you should get in touch with prominent photography bloggers.
